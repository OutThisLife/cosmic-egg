This is a nextjs project where there are some basic guidelines:
 
 - Use `'browser' in process` to test for client, not typeof window
 - Add routes logically to `app/` and create skeletons using `loading.ts`
 - Be intelligent about nesting `layout.tsx`
 - Hooks go to `src/hooks`
 - Components go to `src/components` with UI tokens (atoms) going to `src/components/ui`
 - Providers go to `src/providers` and should never export their own hook (to keep in hooks dir)
 - Utils go to `src/utils`

 Never run 'next dev' or 'next build' commands on behalf of the user.
